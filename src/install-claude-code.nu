# Claude Code is a terminal-based agentic AI. See Getting Started:
# <https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/getting-started>
#
# npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# No idea why they changed it, but this is what Anthropic now recommends:
# <https://claude.ai/code/family>
curl -fsSL https://claude.ai/install.sh | bash

# Their quickstart recommends yet a third way:
# <https://code.claude.com/docs/en/quickstart>
#
# brew install --cask claude-code
