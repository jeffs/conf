# User-level Claude Code instructions

## Git Conventions

Do not include "Generated with Claude Code" in commit or PR messages. Co-authored-by trailers are fine.

## Markdown Conventions

Stick to common, pandoc-compatible conventions. Include blank lines after headers, and before lists or code blocks.

## Quality

You MUST PROVE all work is correct before considering it done. Use static gaurantees (such as types) where possible, and thorough testing always.
When weighing time and effort vs. correctness, ALWAYS prioritize correctness.
