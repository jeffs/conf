# User-level Claude Code instructions

## Git Conventions

Do not include "Generated with Claude Code" in commit or PR messages. Co-authored-by trailers are fine.

## Markdown Conventions

Stick to common, pandoc-compatible conventions. Include blank lines after headers, and before lists or code blocks.
