# Editor config
#
# Which config to commit to which repos quickly gets complicated. The "right"
# solution may be to selectively ignore files on a repo-by-repo basis; but,
# since that requires maintenance and coordination, a blanket workaround is
# employed here. The situation would be a bit nicer if Git supported multiple
# global "excludes" files as well as multiple repo-local "ignore" files.
