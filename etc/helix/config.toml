# I use the mouse for Wezterm, and Helix gets in the way by default, like by
# stealing Command+click (which I use to drag Wezterm windows). Wezterm
# automatically translates scroll events to move the cursor up or down several
# lines at a time when Helix is active, which is nice. Selective remapping of
# mouse gestures in Helix is pending:

#   config overrides it. It _seems_ like setting editor.auto-pairs should
#   work unless language.auto-pairs has been set explicitly by the user, but
#   it doesn't. See also:
#   <https://docs.helix-editor.com/editor.html#editorauto-pairs-section>
# * There doesn't seem to be any way to modify the default. You have
#   to explicitly restate the entire mappin, even when that mapping is
#   language-specific.

# entire collection explicitly.
