# To Do

* [ ] Tab completion/expansion; for example:
  1. Name: `j mo<Tab>` => `j month`
  2. Path: `j cl<Tab>` => `j /Users/jeff/log/2025/03/27`
* [ ] Relative jump targets, e.g., `j bfp/...` or `j g/...` (to alias `g` for `~/git`)
* How should jump support complex ideas like "yesterday's date"
* Separate path and command expansion; e.g., support `open -a Finder $(jump cl)`
